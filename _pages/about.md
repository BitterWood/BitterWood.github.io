I am a fifth-year undergraduate student in Basic Medicine Sciences at the [Peking University Health Science Center](https://www.bjmu.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yang](https://ebiomed.pku.edu.cn/). My research interests include pan-cancer screening of functional teRNAs and AI-assisted description of RBP binding landscape.

Research interests
======
1. Geometric Deep Learning and Protein Structural Bioinformatics: Focused on developing advanced neural network architectures (such as Geometric Vector Perceptrons) to solve complex problems in structural biology. This includes performing accurate Model Quality Assessment (MQA) for antibody-antigen interfaces, bridging the "ranking gap" in folding engines like AlphaFold 3, and enhancing the precision of therapeutic protein design.
1. Immuno-Genomics and Endogenous Retroviruses in Cancer: Investigating the functional role of Human Endogenous Retroviruses (HERVs) within the tumor microenvironment. This research focuses on identifying locus-specific biomarkers (e.g., ERVK18) to characterize "inflamed" tumor phenotypes and predict patient responsiveness to immunotherapy, particularly in aggressive malignancies like Small Cell Lung Cancer.
1. Multi-modal Systems Biomedicine and Spatial Analysis: Integrating high-dimensional biological data—ranging from single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial proteomics to backbone atom coordinates—to model biological systems. This approach seeks to understand the interplay between molecular-level geometric signatures and systemic-level immune responses to guide personalized clinical decision-making.
